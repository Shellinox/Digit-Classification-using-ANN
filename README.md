# Digit Classification with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a Digit Classification model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model is designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.


## Introduction

Digit classification is a fundamental task in computer vision. This project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset for image classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
